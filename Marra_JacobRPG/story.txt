1 |It's March 30th, 9:00 AM. After 3 weeks of no work, you open Program 2 for the first time the day it's due. Do you acknowledge your procrastination and let your grade take a hit? Or do you head to the library and get to work?| 2 | 3
2 |"Damn," you mutter to yourself, wallowing in shame. "Maybe I should've listened to Professor Manju yelling in our ear all week to start early instead of playing Marvel Rivals." Your grade plummets to a D. Enjoy spring break! | -1 | -1
3 |Off to the library you go, old crusty Macbook in hand. You pass by the food court on your way there. The smell is extremely tempting. Do you stop to grab a bite or focus on getting to the study center?| 4 | 6
4 |Halal shack sounds amazing, so you stop by and despite being broke spend $16 on a single meal. You bump into your friends in line, and they invite you to a Mario Party hangout. Do you go or rush to the library to get to work?| 5 | 6
5 |Your undying determination to not do work has gotten the best of you, and now you're way too distracted. Before you know it the time reaches 12:00, and you didn't commit any code. Your grade plummets to a D. Enjoy spring break!| -1 | -1
6 |Despite constant distractions, you finally make it to the library and find an open desk. Since you were foolish enough to bring your phone with you, your friend keeps blowing it up with reels and funny videos. Do you take a break to watch or continue working?| 5 | 7
7 |No more distractions. Your GameDecisionTree is looking pretty good - you just finished getting the file to finally read properly after 3 hours of slamming your head against a wall. A student next to you asks if you could help him with a discrete assignment. Do you help or continue working?| 8 | 9
8 |You realize the problem he needs help with is a set equivalence problem. Since set equivalence problems take 80 billion years to finish by the time you're done the earth has already been turned to dust. Program 2 does not exist anymore. You will be endlessly floating in space for the rest of time.| -1 | -1
9 |You brush the desperate student aside and continue coding. Now for whatever reason your .txt file isn't being read anymore despite your file code not changing at all. Do you ignore the problem and keep going or triple check your file code and see if anything's off?| 10 | 11
10 |Probably was just an issue with the new function you wrote, You keep trekking on, continuously plummeting through error after error. What the hell does "malloc: *** error for object 0x60000027c340" mean anyway??? You sink to the floor in shame. You can't think of any solutions and admit defeat. Enjoy spring break!| -1 | -1
11 |You accidentally deleted a single semicolon by mistake when going over your file code. The file reader works now! With your binary tree system properly working, all that's left is to make a witty coherent story. Do you write about your terrifying experience today or write about something more unrealistic?| 12 | 13
12 |After having 4 PTSD attacks, you finally write a coherent story about your time on Program 2. Your program is finally done! Do you make any quick final changes or just submit and forget about it?| 14 | 15
13 |You write the coolest story ever about a lowly servant who eventually defeats Thanatos, God of Death. Your binary tree has a depth of 104. Professor Manju, however, fell asleep at option 3. Now there's nobody to grade your program. You're a horrible writer.| -1 | -1
14 |You realize your README page is completely empty. Good thing you triple checked before submitting! You spend an extra 30 minutes explaining your spaghetti code and commit your changes. Your grade looks amazing now! Good job! Happy spring break!| -1 | -1
15 |After toiling on this project for what seems like forever, you finally finish your story.txt and press submit. Your program executes perfectly! Except for the fact that you completely forgot to finish your README file. Great work. All that work just to get so many easy points docked off. Your grade plummets to an F. Enjoy spring break!| -1 | -1
